          <p class="description">Visual Designer,  Jul '19 - Present<br><br>
            At Google, I am a Visual Designer based within the People Development Team. I have been tasked with focusing on user-centered design principles to produce high-quality, beautiful and engaging learning material, from concept to execution.
            During my time here, I have also worked on several other projects, including global site redesigns, presentation materials and supporting documents. </p>

          <p class="title">Office Freedom</p>
          <p class="description">Visual Designer,  March '19 - July '19 <br><br>I was the in-house graphic designer for a global coworking broker, creating all graphic materials (such as presentations, documents for print and digital, reports & pitch decks) and web designs (custom web elements for ux/ui testing, & landing pages/ White Label widgets for alternate revenue streams). These were mainly created for the London and Manhattan offices.

          I also worked closely with the marketing team, providing graphics and designs for social media posts and promotional materials.</p>

          <p class="title">Netrix</p>
          <p class="description">Visual Designer, Sept '18 - Mar '19<br><br>
          I was the in-house web designer for an award-winning design agency, representing over 20 clients. Nertrix specialised in bespoke website designs for mobile and web. I worked on a range of projects for different users, and saw the client through the entire design process, from initial wireframing to front end development (using HTML/CSS, specifically LESS).
          Other tasks included infographic design, HTML email design and development, and UX design. </p>

          Myself and my teammate were chosen from over 400 applicants to attend this 8 week innovation course. We created a product idea, spent 8 weeks honing skills in branding, pitching, presentation design, metrics, social media advertising - and successfully built a functional hardware prototype.
          Alongside this, I created all branding materials for the company, including a logo, pitch deck, business plan, website, social media marketing, advertising and a press kit. </p>
